The best idea here is to start with small habits instead of trying big changes all at once. There are three parts to habits: the cue (what starts it), the routine (what you do), and the reward (what you get). By just slightly changing one of these, you can form good habits more easily. It's a great way to make habits.

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

BJ Fogg say that the universal Behaviour(B) is equal to Motivation(M), Action(A), Prompt(P). Shrinking the habit to its smallest possible version so that little motivation is needed to do it

Suppose, You want to develop habbit of **Daily Reading**.

- **Behavior (B)**: Start by reading
- **Motivation (M)**: Personal Growth and Relaxation
- **Action (A)**: start 15 minutes of reading each day.
- **Prompt (P)**: Set a reminder or link it to a specific time, like after morning coffee.

### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating success after completing a habit is crucial in habit formation as it employs positive reinforcement. Recognizing and enjoying small victories creates a positive association with the behavior, increasing the likelihood of its repetition. This positive reinforcement not only boosts motivation but also contributes to building confidence and a sense of achievement. Celebrations serve as a reward within the habit loop, strengthening the connection between the behavior and a positive outcome. Moreover, by counteracting negativity and making the habit-forming process enjoyable, celebrations help solidify the habit as a regular and sustainable part of one's routine. Whether through simple acknowledgments, small treats, or sharing successes with others, the act of celebrating plays a pivotal role in the long-term success of habit development.

The concept of "the aggregation of marginal gains," as exemplified by Dave Brailsford's transformation of the British Cycling team, is intriguing. It highlights the strategy of making small, 1% improvements in various aspects, which, over time, result in significant overall success. This philosophy not only applies to sports but extends to all aspects of life, showcasing the power of consistent, incremental changes. The idea emphasizes the compounding effect of small habits and improvements, aligning with the broader theme of habit development and the role of the environment in shaping behavior. The focus on small, consistent actions and the compounding impact of marginal gains holds relevance for both personal and professional growth.

### What is the book's perspective about Identity?

In "Atomic Habits," James Clear advocates for anchoring habits to identity, emphasizing that lasting behavior change comes from becoming the person who naturally embodies desired habits. This shift in perspective, focusing on identity over specific outcomes, creates a more sustainable motivation for building effective habits. Clear underscores that habits are not just about what you want to achieve but about the person you aim to become in the process.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

In "Atomic Habits," James Clear offers practical insights on making habits easier to adopt. He emphasizes breaking habits into four stages: cue, craving, response, and reward. Clear suggests making habits attractive, creating an environment that supports them, satisfying immediate cravings, and ensuring ease of initiation. By focusing on these elements, individuals can design habits that are not only achievable but also enjoyable, increasing the likelihood of long-term adherence.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

In "Atomic Habits," James Clear recommends making undesirable habits harder by introducing obstacles or increasing friction. By altering the environment and creating barriers, individuals disrupt the ease of engaging in negative behaviors, making them less likely to occur. Clear emphasizes the significance of designing environments that discourage harmful habits while facilitating the adoption of positive ones.

Let's say the habit I want to eliminate or **reduce excessive screen time before bedtime**.
