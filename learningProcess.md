### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting story I liked was about how Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali often used to make use of the idea of collecting diffuse thoughts and then retrack it with focus to solve their respective problems.

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

It forms an interesting way of leaning things. It emphasize on not always keeping the brain at gun point and expect it to work like crazy, instead of this , it's better to relax a bit, gather yourself and refocus on work.

### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

- Break it into smaller manageable steps
- Try it and do practice
- Self evaluate where you are facing problems
- Practice for 20 hours atleast

### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- Focus should not be about completing task only in given time slot, instead of that it should be about learning with dedication in your time slot.
- When you are focusing a problem cut off all distraction for those minutes atleast.
- Sometime relax and let not keep our ego stick to one problem for hours and hours.
- If you are a slow learner then put that extra effort but never undermine yourself.
