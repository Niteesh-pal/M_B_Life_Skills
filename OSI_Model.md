# OSI MODEL

Open System Interconnection
Its a conceptual model used to describe the function of telecommunication or computer system into seven abstraction layer. These layers help in understanding and designing communication systems by breaking down the complex process of communication into more manageable and organized components.

## Seven Layers of OSI model

- Pysical Layer
- Data Link Layer
- Network Layer
- Transport Layer
- Session Layer
- Presentation Layer
- Application Layer

## Physical Layer

    Deals with the physical connection between devices such as cable, network inferace card and how binary data is being transimmeted in physical medium.

## Data Link Layer

    This layer is responsible for creating reliable link between nodes. The main function of this layer is to make sure
    that data transfer should be error free from one node to another node and it also handle the issues such as framing, addressing and error detection.

## Network Layer
