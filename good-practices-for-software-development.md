# Good Practices for Software Development

### Question 1
### Which point(s) were new to you?
- Seek frequent feedback during implementation to ensure alignment and clarity when requirements are vague.
- Implementation taking longer than usual due to some unexpected issue - Inform relevant team members
- Use the group chat/channels to communicate most of the time. This is preferable over private DMs simply because there are more eyes on the main channel.
- In meetings, keep your video turned on. It will improve the rapport with your team and help improve communication.
- Explain the problem clearly, mention the solutions you tried out to fix the problem
- Use Github gists to share code snippets. Use sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup
- Try to find out relevant team member's work schedules, and set up a call when they are free.
- Be available when someone replies to your message. Things move faster if it's a real-time conversation as compared to a back and forth every hour.
- Remember they have their own work to do as well. Pick and choose your communication medium depending on the situation.
- Always keep your phone on silent. Remove notifications from the home screen. Only keep notifications for work-related apps.
- Make sure you manage your food situation well. Too little food or too much food lead to lower levels of concentration.
- Make sure you do some exercise to keep your energy levels high throughout the day.

### Question 2
### Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
I acknowledge the need for improvement in distraction management. My plan includes refining notifications, setting communication boundaries, and maintaining an organized workspace for enhanced focus.
